Hewoo!! I am Noel, a 21 year old polar bear that writes code on the internet. Right now (as of 09/20/25), I am learning C++ but proficent in Kotlin and Rust. Right now, I am focused on building a startup that bridges open source and enterprise together with software that can work with hobbyists to higher-level enterprise software that follows open source guidelines. You can learn more at [`noelware.org`](https://noelware.org). It is in active development but I hope you can take a look at it and see if it works for you~!
